This map breakdowns each of the 24 high school football teams in the 2011 semifinals and maps them based on their school address. I used a combination of a Google map and Google charts to make it. I have a little bit of information on my blog: http://csessig.wordpress.com/2011/11/10/map-mania/.

It's online at: http://wcfcourier.com/sports/high-school/playoffs2011/
